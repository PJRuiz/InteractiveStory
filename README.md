Choose Your Own Adventure Template

I always wanted to make my own CYOA story, this should serve as a template to prototype decisions and flow without having
to worry about the basic foundational code.

My goal is to eventually create an open-sourced Lifeline-style app for people who simply want to tell stories on their watch, tv or phone.
